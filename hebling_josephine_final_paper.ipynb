In this paper, I assess the inner workings of the UN Security Council (UNSC) since it has the \"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It has 15 Members, and each Member has one vote. Under the Charter of the United Nations, all Member States are obligated to comply with Council decisions.\" (UN Security Council 2023). It is therefore considered to be the most powerful organ internationally, specifically in the adoption of topics related to international peace and security efforts.\n"

        "In order to assess the abovementioned research question, this paper thus procedes in the following steps, and centers around applying text analysis methodology in Python to analyze the respective documents and draw meaningful conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To limit the scope of this analysis, I restrict my assessment to UNSC resolutions adopted in the year 2021. Therefore, I draw from the GitHub respository provided by UNxml (2023) which provides machine-readable versions across several years worth of UNSC resolutions. This way, the text data analyzed is readable in the Python program and the tedious work of reading UN resolution from pdf texts can be circumvented.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2.2 Data Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "First, the aim of this analysis is the recognition of broader text patterns across all UNSC resolutions. This way, a general understanding of the determining characteristics of the texts can be gained, before further moving on with the analysis. Therefore, the methodology of this paper starts with topic models and addresses to what extent there is a broad trend of topics across UNSC resolutions, and how these relate to the work of the Council.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, I further procede by applying the text analysis method term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). This way, the most distinctively frequent or significant words can be found for every respective UNSC resolution. I specifically calculate tf-idf scores using word frequencies per page—or \"extracted features\"—made available by the HathiTrust Digital Library.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason why I apply both topic models and TF-IDF text analysis methods to analyze the texts is centered around the language and tonality of UN resolutions themselves. More specifically, the UNSC resolutions are written in strong diplomatic language and thus are determined by changes in tone and wording typical in international law. For instance, the application of sentiment analysis would not allow for substatial conclusions, as it is a tool designed to evaluate phatic language, rather than the nuances among UN resolutions. Instead, both the topic models and TF-IDF text analysis metodology allows to understand the broader topics covered in the UN texts.\n"

In cases where the Committee informs the Ombudsperson that it has followed his or her recommendation, the Ombudsperson immediately informs the Petitioner of the Committee’s decision and submits to the Committee, for its review, a summary of the analysis contained in the Comprehensive Report.

        "In summary, it is clear that it is possible to determine both which broader patterns and specific issues are discussed in UNSC resolutions. Generally, all UNSC Resolutions are connected by common themes, such as peace and security, humanitarian action, and UN Missions. These broad themes are identified in the topic models, and TF-IDF Models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, text analysis methods are better at identifying resolition topics and themes if both the Preambular Phrases and Operative Phrases are included. If only the Operative Phrases are included, which contain the text in which the member states commit to action, then the text is more general, and diplomatic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, the recognition of topics is more meaningful if the UNSC resolution texts are analyzed in their entirety. This way, the broad patterns and specific topics are quite precisely estimated based on the TF-IDF Models. This is also reflected in the final heatmap, which is visualized in the section above.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the identification of the topics discussed in UNSC Resolution is further relevant, as it inherently links to the preferences of UNSC member states, reflected in their voting behavior. For instance, the UNSC resolutions which are highly contested related to matters on the Middle East, and are commonly vetoed by either the US, China, or the Russian Federation (UN Security Council 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "The identification of reoslution topics is thus highly relevant towards understanding the preferences of UNSC members, and understanding their voting behavior in the Council. This way, we are one step closer towards understanding the underlying mechanisms of topics disucssed in the most powerful international organ on issues related to peace and security."
